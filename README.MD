# Walmart forecasting

Competition to forecast sales for each department in each store based on past sales data. 
I start with an xgbBoost model, and then extract seasonality using fbprophet, before
ensembling the two techniques together. 

The code is functionalised, so comment/uncomment main function calls as desired. For fitting,
all but the initial function must be called in order. For eda, just the first function should
be called.
